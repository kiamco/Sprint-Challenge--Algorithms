#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because even htough the loop checks n^3, a is all getting multiplied by n^2


b) also O(n) because j is being incremented by j*2


c) it will never end 

## Exercise II

given:
  n-story building
  n = number of stories, p = current floor, f = point of inflection

  n > f egg breaks
  n < f egg does not break

solution:

what I would in this situation assuming that these eggs are not from this planet. I would start in the middle, if the egg breaks you take the lower half of the building and disregard the top and go to the middle of the chosen half, if the egg doesnt break to the same thing with the top. Repeat the procces, keep on doing that until your left with only one floor
